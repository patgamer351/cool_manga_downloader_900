# cool_manga_downloader_900
Downloads images from Mangakakalot and has been heavly inspired from manga-cli with a few lines being coppied

This program stores both the images and the .cbz file at the same time in the .cache directory so that way you only need to download the manga once then update the images then compress the images into the .cbz

INSTALL:

git clone https://github.com/patgamer351/cool_manga_downloader_900

sudo make

done!

UNINSTALL:

This program only stores it's files and manga's in both here and the .cache folder

sudo rm -r $HOME/cool_manga_downloader_900

sudo rm -r $HOME/.cache/cool_manga_downloader_900

done!! and thanks for using cool_manga_downloader_900 and please give me suggestions so I can further improve this program, once again thanks!!
